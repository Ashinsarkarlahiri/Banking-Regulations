# Banking-Regulations: Recent Global Regulatory Changes (EU, UK, US)
## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive research-based analysis of the recent changes in global banking regulations, with a strong focus on the Basel III End-Game (Basel 3.1) framework.
The project covers capital, liquidity, stress testing, ICAAP/ILAAP, provisioning, and jurisdiction-wise divergence across Europe, United Kingdom, and the United States.

This project is aligned with modern regulatory expectations in quant risk, banking supervision, capital modelling, and regulatory policy analysis.

## Key Objectives

- Summarize major regulatory developments across Basel, EU, UK, and US regulatory bodies.

- Explain changes in capital requirements across risk types (credit, market, CCR, CVA, operational).

- Compare implementation timelines, calibration, and jurisdictional differences.

- Highlight practical implications for banks, quant teams, and risk management groups.

- Provide a structured, technical, and recruiter-friendly reference document for regulatory analytics.

## Topics Covered
1. **Global Context – The Basel III End-Game**

Basel III/3.1 final reforms: stronger standardised approaches, output floor, IRB limits.

Jurisdiction-level tailoring by EU, UK (PRA), and US regulators.

Shift towards comparability, risk sensitivity, and reduced model arbitrage.

2. **Capital Requirements – Detailed Breakdown**
✔ **Credit Risk (Standardised & IRB)**

Revised risk weights for corporates, SMEs, RE exposures.

Output floor limiting RWA reductions from internal models.

EU adoption via CRR3/CRD6, UK implementation via PRA Basel 3.1.

✔ **Market Risk – FRTB (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book)**

Revised standardized approach

Stricter model approval and P&L attribution tests

Heavy governance requirements across EU & UK

✔ **Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) & CVA**

SA-CCR now the dominant approach.

Revised CVA risk capital rules; reduced modelling flexibility.

✔ **Operational Risk Reform**

Basel III replaces older methods with a single standardised approach.

Higher capital impact for certain business models.

✔ **Output Floor**

Minimum RWAs tied to standardised RWAs (72.5% Basel requirement).

Phased implementation timelines across EU, UK, US.

3. **Provisioning – IFRS 9 vs CECL**

- IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL) framework: adopted in EU, UK.

- US CECL under GAAP: lifetime expected losses for most loans.

**Supervisory focus on:**

- Scenario design

- Forward-looking adjustments

- Model governance and transparency

4. **Stress Testing**
✔ **US (DFAST / CCAR)**

Annual supervisory severely adverse scenarios.

Strong emphasis on CRE stress and corporate credit deterioration.

✔ **EU (EBA Stress Tests)**

Climate, interest-rate, liquidity, and CSRBB risks emphasized.

Standardized ICAAP/ILAAP reporting expectations.

✔ **UK (Bank of England / PRA)**

Household, corporate, and CRE stress.

Integration with PRA Basel 3.1 reforms.

5. **ICAAP & ILAAP Frameworks**

Updated EBA guidelines for internal capital and liquidity assessments.

Increased expectations for scenario governance, documentation, and transparency.

Banks must integrate Basel 3.1 changes into internal adequacy assessments.

6. **Liquidity Management**

LCR and NSFR remain core liquidity standards.

Supervisory focus areas:

Short-term wholesale funding

Intraday liquidity

Margining/central clearing impacts

7. **Pillar 3 Disclosure Enhancements**

More granular reporting on RWAs, risk models, and capital adequacy.

EU CRR3 and UK PRA adopting revised disclosure formats.

8. **Jurisdictional Comparison (EU vs UK vs US)**

- EU: Strong Basel alignment via CRR3/CRD6 beginning 2025+.

- UK: PRA-specific Basel 3.1 calibration with phased rollout to 2030.

- US: Politically sensitive implementation, ongoing revisions to capital and leverage rules.
